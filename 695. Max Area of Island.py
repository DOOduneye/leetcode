# Medium â€” Graph 
# You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
# The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
# Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

# Input: grid = [
#   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
# ]
# Output: 9
