# Medium â€” Graph
# There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you **must** take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
# - For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
# Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

# Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = 1,
# Output: true
# Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
