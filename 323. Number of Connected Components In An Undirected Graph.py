# Medium â€” Graph
# You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n and an array edges where edges[i] = [a_i, b_i] indicates that there is an edge between a_i and b_i in the graph. 
# Return the number of connected components in the graph

# Input: n = 5, edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]
# Output: 2
